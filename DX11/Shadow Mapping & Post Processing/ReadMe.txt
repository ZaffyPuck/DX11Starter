--Extra Texture Feature--
I added the ability to scale and offset the textures
I added the specular scaling per pixel
ImGUI can control the textures (UV) scale and offset
ImGUI displayes images of the textures being used

--More Options--
These are things that I can still add
- Add spec in alpha channel of texture
- Add second tecture as overlay/mask
